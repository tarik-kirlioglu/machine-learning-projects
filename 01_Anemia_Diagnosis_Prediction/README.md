# Anemia Diagnosis Prediction

This project aims to create a machine learning model for anemia diagnosis. Using a dataset from Kaggle, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and model training were performed.The dataset contains medical records of patients, and the goal is to develop a model that accurately diagnoses anemia based on the provided features.

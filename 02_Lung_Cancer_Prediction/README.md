# Lung Cancer Prediction

This project aims to create different machine learning models for lung cancer prediction. Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, model training, and performance evaluation were performed using a dataset from Kaggle.The dataset includes patient information and various health metrics to train models that can predict the likelihood of lung cancer.The features in the columns are represented by Yes:2 and No:1.

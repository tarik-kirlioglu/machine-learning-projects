# Sleep Quality Score Prediction
This project involves predicting sleep quality using a Random Forest regression model. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is first subjected to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and distribution, with various visualizations created to explore data patterns and relationships. The data is then used for training the model. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²). The code includes data loading, EDA, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation steps.
